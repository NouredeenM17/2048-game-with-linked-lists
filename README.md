This is a mock-up game where a sequence of blocks of different numerical values drop onto the grid. Blocks of equal values merge into a single block of double the value.
Multi-linked lists were used as the data structure that holds the block data.

This was created in "Data Structures" class in the first semester of my second year in Computer Engineering. Detailed analysis Below.
